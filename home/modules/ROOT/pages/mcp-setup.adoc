= MCP Remote Server
:description: Learn how to connect to the Redpanda documentation MCP server in Cursor, VSCode, and other AI tools.

The Redpanda documentation provides a remote *Model Context Protocol (MCP)* server that allows you to find information from the Redpanda documentation in your IDEs or AI tools, such as Cursor.

Redpanda hosts a Streamable HTTP MCP server available at `https://docs.redpanda.com/mcp`. You can add it to AI agents that support connecting to MCP servers.

== Other AI tools

Any AI tool that supports MCP servers can connect to the Redpanda documentation server using the URL:

[source,text]
----
https://docs.redpanda.com/mcp
----

This MCP server is powered by the Redpanda documentation and provides real-time access to our knowledge base.

== What you can do

When you're connected, you can ask the MCP server questions about Redpanda directly from your AI assistant. For example:

* "How do I configure Redpanda for production?"
* "What are the best practices for Redpanda topic partitioning?"
* "How do I set up Redpanda Connect?"
* "What are Redpanda's security features?"

== Usage limits

The MCP server has a rate limit of *30 questions per 15-minute window* to ensure fair usage and optimal performance for all users.

If you exceed this limit, you'll need to wait before making additional requests.
