= MCP Server for Redpanda Documentation
:description: Learn how to connect to the Redpanda documentation MCP server in Cursor, VS Code, ChatGPT, and other AI tools.

Redpanda provides a remote link:https://modelcontextprotocol.io[Model Context Protocol (MCP) server^] that lets you access authoritative Redpanda documentation directly from your IDE or AI tool, such as Cursor, VS Code, ChatGPT, or Claude.

The MCP server is hosted at: `\https://docs.redpanda.com/mcp`.
You can add this endpoint to any AI agent that supports MCP.

== Set up

[tabs]
====
Cursor::
+
--
Add the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json` file:

[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "redpanda": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://docs.redpanda.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
----

For more information about MCP in Cursor, see the https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol[Cursor documentation^].
--
VS Code::
+
--
*Prerequisites:* VS Code 1.102+ with GitHub Copilot enabled.

Create an `mcp.json` file in your workspace `.vscode` folder:

.`.vscode/mcp.json`
[source,json]
----
{
  "servers": {
    "redpanda": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://docs.redpanda.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
----

To configure globally for all workspaces:

. Open Command Palette (kbd:[Cmd+Shift+P] / kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P])
. Run **MCP: Open User Configuration**
. Add the same JSON configuration

*Using MCP in VS Code:*

. Open the Chat view (kbd:[Ctrl+Cmd+I] / kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+I]).
. Select **Agent mode** from the dropdown.
. Click the **Tools** button to see available MCP tools.
. Ask questions about Redpanda and the AI automatically uses the documentation.

For more details, see the https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers[VS Code MCP documentation^].
--
ChatGPT Desktop::
+
--
ChatGPT Desktop supports MCP servers in developer mode. To enable:

. Open ChatGPT Desktop.
. Go to **Settings** > **Features**.
. Enable **Developer mode**.
. Navigate to **Settings** > **MCP Servers**.
. Click **Add Server** and enter:
+
- **Name**: `redpanda`
- **URL**: `https://docs.redpanda.com/mcp`


For more information, see the https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/developer-mode[ChatGPT Desktop MCP documentation^].
--
Claude Desktop::
+
--
To add Redpanda's MCP server to Claude Desktop:

**On macOS:**
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**On Windows:**
`%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add this configuration:

[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "redpanda": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://docs.redpanda.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
----

Restart Claude Desktop for changes to take effect.

== Intended use

This public MCP endpoint is designed for:

* Evaluation and testing
* IDE-based assistance and ad-hoc queries
* Individual developer productivity

*Not suitable for:*

* High-volume automation or batch processing
* Production services or runbooks
* CI/CD pipelines or scheduled jobs

== Other AI tools

Any tool that supports MCP servers can connect using the following URL:

[source,text]
----
https://docs.redpanda.com/mcp
----

NOTE: MCP support varies by tool and version. Check the specific tool's documentation for MCP setup instructions.

== What you can do

Once connected, you can ask context-aware questions about Redpanda from within your editor:

* "How do I configure Redpanda for production?"
* "What are the instructions for running Redpanda in a local Kind cluster?"
* "What are the best practices for topic partitioning in Redpanda?"
* "What are Redpanda's security features and authentication methods?"
* "How do I monitor Redpanda cluster performance?"
* "What's the difference between Redpanda Cloud and self-hosted deployment?"

== Usage limits

To ensure fair use and performance for all users, the public MCP endpoint enforces the following rate limits per user:

* **60 requests per 15 minutes**

As well as this global limit, the `ask_redpanda_question` tool proxies to an MCP server hosted by Kapa.ai, which enforces its own limits. See the link:https://docs.kapa.ai/integrations/mcp/overview#authentication[Kapa documentation^] for details.

These limits are suitable for:

* Individual developer IDE usage
* Ad-hoc documentation queries
* Evaluation and testing

If you exceed the limit, you receive an HTTP 429 response with rate limit headers. Wait until the reset time before retrying.

----

RateLimit-Limit: 40
RateLimit-Remaining: 0
RateLimit-Reset: <timestamp>

== Troubleshooting

=== Server not connecting

* Verify the URL is exactly: `https://docs.redpanda.com/mcp`.
* Check your internet connection.
* Ensure your AI tool supports HTTP-based MCP servers.
* Restart your AI tool after adding the configuration.

=== VS Code specific issues

* Ensure you have VS Code 1.102 or later.
* Verify GitHub Copilot is installed and enabled.
* Try running **MCP: Reset Cached Tools** from the Command Palette.
* Check the Output panel (*View* > *Output* > *MCP*) for error messages.

=== Configuration issues

* Ensure `"type": "http"` is specified in your configuration for HTTP-based MCP servers.
* Some MCP clients may have issues with SSE streaming. If you experience connection problems, verify that your client supports HTTP-based MCP servers with Server-Sent Events (SSE).
* Check that your client's Accept headers include both `application/json` and `text/event-stream`.

=== Rate limiting

If you're building automation or high-volume integrations and hitting rate limits frequently:

* The public endpoint's rate limits are intentionally restrictive for fair use.
* Consider implementing caching on your side to reduce duplicate queries.

=== Other issues

Check the https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers[MCP GitHub repository^] for additional troubleshooting guidance or https://github.com/redpanda-data/docs-site/issues[report an issue^] with our documentation.
