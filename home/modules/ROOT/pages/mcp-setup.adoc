= MCP Server for Redpanda Documentation
:description: Learn how to connect to the Redpanda documentation MCP server in Cursor, VS Code, ChatGPT, and other AI tools.

Redpanda provides a remote link:https://modelcontextprotocol.io[Model Context Protocol (MCP) server^] that lets you access authoritative Redpanda documentation directly from your IDE or AI tool, such as Cursor, VS Code, ChatGPT, or Claude.

The MCP server is hosted at: `https://docs.redpanda.com/mcp`.
You can add this endpoint to any AI agent that supports MCP.

== Other AI tools

Any tool that supports MCP servers can connect using the following URL:

[source,text]
----
https://docs.redpanda.com/mcp
----

NOTE: MCP support varies by tool and version. Check the specific tool's documentation for MCP setup instructions.

== What you can do

Once connected, you can ask context-aware questions about Redpanda from within your editor:

* "How do I configure Redpanda for production?"
* "What are the instructions for running Redpanda in a local Kind cluster?"
* "What are the best practices for topic partitioning in Redpanda?"
* "What are Redpanda's security features and authentication methods?"
* "How do I monitor Redpanda cluster performance?"
* "What's the difference between Redpanda Cloud and self-hosted deployment?"

== Usage limits

To ensure fair use and performance, the server enforces a rate limit of **60 questions per 15-minute window**.

If you exceed the limit, you'll see a rate limit error message. Wait a few minutes before retrying.

== Troubleshooting

=== Server not connecting

* Verify the URL is exactly: `https://docs.redpanda.com/mcp`.
* Check your internet connection.
* Ensure your AI tool supports HTTP-based MCP servers.
* Restart your AI tool after adding the configuration.

=== VS Code specific issues

* Ensure you have VS Code 1.102 or later.
* Verify GitHub Copilot is installed and enabled.
* Try running **MCP: Reset Cached Tools** from the Command Palette.
* Check the Output panel (*View* > *Output* > *MCP*) for error messages.

=== Other issues

Check the https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers[MCP GitHub repository^] for additional troubleshooting guidance or https://github.com/redpanda-data/docs-site/issues[report an issue^] with our documentation.
