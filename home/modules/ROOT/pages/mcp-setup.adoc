= MCP Server for Redpanda Documentation
:description: Learn how to connect to the Redpanda documentation MCP server in Cursor, VS Code, ChatGPT, and other AI tools.

Redpanda provides a remote link:https://modelcontextprotocol.io[Model Context Protocol (MCP) server^] that lets you access authoritative Redpanda documentation directly from your IDE or AI tool, such as Cursor, VS Code, ChatGPT, or Claude.

The MCP server is hosted at: `\https://redpanda.mcp.kapa.ai`.
You can add this endpoint to any AI agent that supports MCP.

.Deprecation notice
[IMPORTANT]
====
The previous endpoint at `\https://docs.redpanda.com/mcp` is deprecated and will be shut down in **February 2026**. If you're currently using the old endpoint, please update your configuration to use the new Kapa-hosted endpoint: `\https://redpanda.mcp.kapa.ai`.

The new endpoint offers improved reliability, built-in authentication, and better rate limiting.
====

== Set up

[tabs]
====
Cursor::
+
--
Add the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json` file:

[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "redpanda": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://redpanda.mcp.kapa.ai"
    }
  }
}
----

For more information about MCP in Cursor, see the https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol[Cursor documentation^].
--
VS Code::
+
--
*Prerequisites:* VS Code 1.102+ with GitHub Copilot enabled.

Create an `mcp.json` file in your workspace `.vscode` folder:

.`.vscode/mcp.json`
[source,json]

. Navigate to **Settings** > **MCP Servers**.
. Click **Add Server** and enter:
+
- **Name**: `redpanda`
- **URL**: `https://redpanda.mcp.kapa.ai`


For more information, see the https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/developer-mode[ChatGPT Desktop MCP documentation^].
--
Claude Desktop::
+
--
To add Redpanda's MCP server to Claude Desktop:

**On macOS:**
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**On Windows:**
`%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add this configuration:

[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "redpanda": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://redpanda.mcp.kapa.ai"
    }
  }
}
----

Restart Claude Desktop for changes to take effect.

== Intended use

This public MCP endpoint is designed for:

* Evaluation and testing
* IDE-based assistance and ad-hoc queries
* Individual developer productivity

*Not suitable for:*

* High-volume automation or batch processing
* Production services or runbooks
* CI/CD pipelines or scheduled jobs

=== Technical specifications

* *Transport*: HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming support
* *Rate limits*: 40 requests per hour and 200 requests per day per user
* *Authentication*: Google OAuth sign-in (first-time connection only)

== Other AI tools

Any tool that supports MCP servers can connect using the following URL:

[source,text]
----
https://redpanda.mcp.kapa.ai
----

NOTE: MCP support varies by tool and version. Check the specific tool's documentation for MCP setup instructions.

== What you can do

Once connected, you can ask context-aware questions about Redpanda from within your editor:

* "How do I configure Redpanda for production?"
* "What are the instructions for running Redpanda in a local Kind cluster?"
* "What are the best practices for topic partitioning in Redpanda?"
* "What are Redpanda's security features and authentication methods?"
* "How do I monitor Redpanda cluster performance?"
* "What's the difference between Redpanda Cloud and self-hosted deployment?"

== Authentication

When you connect to the Redpanda MCP server for the first time, you need to authenticate using Google OAuth.

The authentication process varies by client:

[tabs]
====
Claude Code::
+
--
. Type `/mcp` in the chat.
. Select the Redpanda MCP server from the list.
. Click **Authenticate**.
. A browser window opens for Google sign-in.
. Sign in with your Google account.
. Return to Claude Code.

Authentication is complete.
--
Cursor::
+
--
. Open the MCP panel or chat.
. Look for the Redpanda MCP server in your configured servers.
. When prompted, click to authenticate.
. A browser window opens for Google sign-in.
. Sign in with your Google account.
. Return to Cursor.

Authentication is complete.
--
VS Code::
+
--
. Open the Chat view (kbd:[Ctrl+Cmd+I] / kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+I]).
. Select **Agent mode**.
. Click the **Tools** button to see MCP tools.
. If authentication is required, VS Code prompts you to authenticate.
. A browser window opens for Google sign-in.
. Sign in with your Google account.
. Return to VS Code.

Authentication is complete.
--
Other clients::
+
--
Most MCP clients automatically prompt for authentication when you first use an MCP tool or server. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete Google OAuth authentication.
--
====

The MCP server:

* Requests only the `openid` scope from Google
* Receives an ID token (a JWT) that contains a stable, opaque user ID (`sub`)
* Does not request the `email` or `profile` scopes, so the server does not see your name, email address, or other personal data

This anonymous Google ID is used only to enforce per-user rate limits and prevent abuse of the MCP server.

On the Google consent screen, this appears as "Associate you with your personal info on Google." This is Google's generic wording for the `openid` scope: it means the app can recognize that the same Google account is signing in again. It does not grant access to your email, name, contacts, or other data, which would require additional scopes such as `email` or `profile`.

== Usage limits

To ensure fair use and performance for all users, the public MCP endpoint enforces the following rate limits per user:

* **40 requests per hour**
* **200 requests per day**

These limits are suitable for:

* Individual developer IDE usage
* Ad-hoc documentation queries
* Evaluation and testing

If you exceed the limit, you receive an HTTP 429 response with rate limit headers. Wait until the reset time before retrying.

----
HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
RateLimit-Limit: 40
RateLimit-Remaining: 0
RateLimit-Reset: <timestamp>
----

== Troubleshooting

=== Server not connecting

* Verify the URL is exactly: `https://redpanda.mcp.kapa.ai`.
* Check your internet connection.
* Ensure your AI tool supports HTTP-based MCP servers.
* Restart your AI tool after adding the configuration.

=== VS Code specific issues

* Ensure you have VS Code 1.102 or later.
* Verify GitHub Copilot is installed and enabled.
* Try running **MCP: Reset Cached Tools** from the Command Palette.
* Check the Output panel (*View* > *Output* > *MCP*) for error messages.

=== Configuration issues

* Ensure `"type": "http"` is specified in your configuration for HTTP-based MCP servers.
* Some MCP clients may have issues with SSE streaming. If you experience connection problems, verify that your client supports HTTP-based MCP servers with Server-Sent Events (SSE).
* Check that your client's Accept headers include both `application/json` and `text/event-stream`.

=== Rate limiting

If you're building automation or high-volume integrations and hitting rate limits frequently:

* The public endpoint's rate limits (40 requests per hour, 200 requests per day) are intentionally restrictive for fair use.
* Consider implementing caching on your side to reduce duplicate queries.

=== Other issues
