The Redpanda Documentation Style Guide provides guidance on writing product documentation.

TIP: For help with Asciidoc, see the {url-asciidoc}[Asciidoc syntax quick reference].

== Style guide update and approval process

This guide is intended to be helpful to documentation team writers and reviewers.

* If you are a member of the Redpanda documentation team, you should propose your updates to your docs team peers before adding to this document. For example, you can demo at a team meeting or in the #doc-team Slack group.
* If you are not a member of the Redpanda doc team, you should start a conversation on https://rpnda.co/slack[the community channel].

== Organization of product documentation

Before you start writing, create an outline with the information you intend to add to each section. It might look something like this:

* *Overview* - This is an introduction to the feature and contains use cases, architecture, and any important notes, such as whether the feature is in technical preview.
** *Always include use cases* - What will the user be able to accomplish with the feature? Examples are great!
* *Configuration or Setting up* - This section contains everything Redpanda users need to do before using the feature. You can split this into multiple subheadings that contain information about configuration parameters, initial commands they need to run, etc. This can be in paragraph form or a list of steps, depending on what will provide the best possible user experience.
** *Prerequisites* - This should be a bullet list toward the beginning of the *Setting up* section. Include all software and hardware requirements.
* *Conceptual information* - Sections that are titled according to the requirements of the feature. Split them up into short sections of a few paragraphs. Use bullet lists and code blocks to make the text easier to read.
* *How-to information* - If step-by-step actions are required to use the feature, place them here. This can be useful for customers who are trying to complete a task quickly without wading through the conceptual information in the previous sections.
* *Reference material* - This can be anything; for example, a simple list of additional configuration parameters.
* *Troubleshooting or debugging information* - If troubleshooting or debugging information is available, place in this section.
* *What’s next* - After a customer completes the task described, what is the next logical step in their implementation journey? Include appropriate links to logical next steps that will help guide them through the adoption, implementation, and deployment process.

== Language and grammar

=== Capitalization and punctuation

IMPORTANT: These are meant as guidelines for new topics. If you are updating an existing topic, follow the existing capitalization convention in that topic. For example, if a topic is using title case, then use title case so it matches. Mixing title types is worse than not following the style guide.

- For navtree topic titles (those appearing in the primary topic navtree), use init caps. For example: “Technical Preview”, or “Consumer Offsets”.
- For h2 and lower headings (those appearing in the right navigation pane), use sentence style capitalization. For example,  “Editing cluster properties”, or “Prepare infrastructure”.

In text, follow the standard capitalization rules for American English. Additionally:

- Don't use all uppercase for emphasis.
- Follow the official capitalization for the names of brands, companies, software, products, services, and the like.
- Avoid camel case and all caps. Some screen readers read capitalized letters individually, and some languages are unicase.
- Capitalization in lists: Use sentence case for items in all types of lists.
- Do not capitalize general terms, such as worker, workers, consumer, producer, topic, cluster, etc.
- Use parentheses judiciously. Don't put important information in parentheses if you can help it.

=== Commands and code

Don’t start a sentence with a command or code. Instead, try to move the code into the middle of the sentence. Introduce the command with the more descriptive word “run” instead of “use the X command".
- *Correct:* Run the `rpk topic create` command to create a new topic.
- *Incorrect:* `rpk topic create` creates a new topic.

Similarly, do not start a sentence with a filename. For example:
- *Correct:* The `redpanda.yaml` file contains configuration parameters.
- *Incorrect:* `redpanda.yaml` contains configuration parameters.

=== Commas

Use serial (Oxford) commas. In a series of three or more items, use a comma before the last item (before the and or or).

- *Correct:* The purchase event is defined by product, payment, and delivery.
- *Incorrect:* The purchase event is defined by product, payment and delivery.

=== Contractions

We write our documentation in an informal tone, so you can use most types of contractions.

**Negation contractions**

In particular, it's fine to use -n't contractions, such as isn't, don't, and can't.

One reason that such contractions are useful is that it's sometimes easy for a reader to miss the word not, whereas it's harder to misread don't as do.

**Noun + verb contractions**

In general, avoid contractions formed from nouns and verbs.

*Recommended:* The browser is fast, simple, and secure.

*Not recommended:* The browser's fast, simple, and secure.

The first example is better because using 's in place of is could cause the reader to think that browser's is the possessive form.

In some cases, it's okay to use a noun + verb contraction, such as, "If you want to display information, a table's your best option." However, in general, try to avoid that kind of contraction.

*Recommended:* The following guides are a good way to learn to use Universal Analytics.

*Not recommended:* The following guides're a good way to learn to use Universal Analytics.

**Don't use double contractions**

Double contractions contain not just one but two contracted words. Some examples of double contractions are as follows:

- mightn't've (mightn't have → might not have)
- mustn't've (mustn't have → must not have)
- wouldn't've (wouldn't have → would not have)
- shouldn't've (shouldn't have → should not have)

**Its and It’s**

Don't confuse its (possessive) with it's (noun + verb).

=== Filenames

Make file and directory names lowercase. In general, separate words with hyphens, not underscores. Use only standard ASCII alphanumeric characters in file and directory names.

=== Titles and headings

In the titles and headings that show up in the left nav, use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case[title case] (for example, “Node Management”).

In section titles within a doc, `<h2>` and below, use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Sentence_case[sentence case] (for example, “Available versions”).

Always use the imperative in headings. For example, use “Configure Producers” instead of “Configuring Producers”.

== Voice and tone
- Use the second person ("you") when speaking to or about the reader.
- Don’t use "we", "our", or "let's" as if author and reader were a hybrid entity.
**Good:** "Configure your terminal window"
**Bad:** "We configure the terminal window" or "The terminal window is configured"

- Start task instructions with the imperative. For example, say “Set the environment variable” instead of “To set the environment variable” or “You can set the environment variable”.

- Focus on facts, real user tasks, and real user benefits. Avoid promotional hype at all
costs.

- Use shorter words over longer alternatives. Examples: "helps" rather than "facilitates"
and "uses" rather than "utilizes."

- Use active voice where possible. Passive voice is acceptable when any of these
conditions is true:
  - The system performs the action.
  - It is more appropriate to focus on the receiver of the action.
  - You want to avoid blaming the user for an error, such as in an error message.
  - The information is clearer in passive voice.

* Avoid calling out the version in text ("Starting in version x.x...") unless the feature was slipped in during a point/patch release and not announced in major version Release Notes. 

* Avoid using future tense, such as "will". Especially avoid the use of future and
passive used in tandem, such as "will not be". 

* If a sentence contains a conditional phrase, put it at the beginning of the sentence. That way, the reader can skip the rest of the sentence with confidence if the condition doesn't apply.

* Aim for economical expression. Omit weak modifiers such as "quite," "very," and
"extremely." Weak modifiers have a diluting effect.

* Avoid weak verbs such as "is," "are," "has," "have," "do," "does," "provide," and "support." Weak verbs require more wordy constructions. Don’t start a sentence with "There is..." or "There are...", which are empty phrases that add no meaning. Instead, rearrange the sentence so the subject comes first. For example, change “There are three ways to do this” to “You can do this in three ways”.

== GUI style guidelines

=== Screenshots
- Avoid including screenshots in product documentation. If you must include a screenshot, do so sparingly and strategically. Focus images on the specific UI feature (in other words, don't capture the left nav unless necessary).

- Screenshots create technical debt, since they must be maintained as the product changes. They also create a localization burden.

=== Referring to UI elements
Because UI design changes occur often and without notice (no doc Issue filed), avoid referring to the exact location of an interface control if possible.

**Navigation menu**

Refer to the leftmost navigation menu as "navigation menu" rather than the general term "interface." You can direct users to submenu items with the bracket symbol (>). For example, "From the navigation menu, select Deployment > Starting a local cluster."

**Pages**

When users select an item from the navigation menu, they land on a page. For example, a user would select Security from the navigation menu, and the Security page displays.

**Panes**

Areas within a dialog or page are referred to as a “pane.” 

**Minimalism**

To write in a minimalist style, omit words like "the" and "button." It cuts down on potential translation costs and prevents maintenance if the UI design changes. For example, instead of writing, “Click the **Add** button,” write “Click **Add**.”

|===

=== Acronyms or abbreviation

In general, when an abbreviation is likely to be unfamiliar to the audience, spell out the first mention of the term and immediately follow with the abbreviation in parentheses.

== Cross-references

Cross-reference links should be constructed to provide meaning ("why") before the link. Introduce links to other documentation topics with “see”, not “refer to”. Be mindful that users on mobile might have a hard time clicking on small links.

- Use meaningful link:https://developers.google.com/style/link-text[text].
    **Correct:** To begin coding right away, see link:https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp[Building your first app].
    **Incorrect:** Click here.
    **Incorrect:** See this blog post.

- If a link downloads a file, then make that clear in the link text, and mention the file type.
    **Correct:** For more information, see link:https://www.example.com/security.pdf[download the security features PDF].

- If the link text doesn’t clearly indicate why you're referring the reader to this information, then give an explanation. Make the explanation specific, but don't repeat the link text.
    **Correct:** For more information about authentication and authorization, see link:https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2[Using OAuth 2.0 to access Google APIs].

- Do not link to outside sources like wikipedia for definitions. Every link can distract readers away from the reason they came to that page in the first place.

== Example domains and names
- Do not use abbreviations that are profane (RTFM, IDGAF).

- Do not use examples that contain any customer-identifiable information, such as CLASSPATH.

== File types

When you're discussing a file type, use the formal name of the type. (The file type name is often in all caps because many file type names are acronyms or initialisms.) Do not use the filename extension to refer generically to the file type.

The following table lists examples of filename extensions and the corresponding file type names to use.

[options="header"]

|===


== Fonts and variables

Specific fonts for specific types of text.

=== Code fences

We use monospace fonts in the same contexts across teams. In AsciiDoc, use backticks to denote code text; for example, `rp-type`. The following types of text should be denoted as code:

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Text | Example

| CLI commands
| `rpk topic create`

| File paths
| `/lib/systemd/system/redpanda.service`

| File types
| `.yaml, .log`

| Filenames
| `redpanda.yaml`

| rpk
| `rpk`

| Tags and configuration parameters
| `rp-type=topic-manifest`
|===

=== Code blocks

Use code blocks for large blocks of code, file snippets, or commands that you want to make easy to read and copy. For example:

To create a topic with remote read enabled, use this command:

....
[,bash]
----
rpk topic create <topic-name> -c redpanda.remote.read=true
----
....

To add line numbers to the code block, add the `line-numbers` role:

....
[,bash,role="line-numbers"]
----
rpk topic create <topic-name> -c redpanda.remote.read=true
----
....

To hide the copy button on the code block, add the `no-copy` role:

....
[,bash,role="no-copy"]
----
rpk topic create <topic-name> -c redpanda.remote.read=true
----
....

To add more than one role, use a comma:

....
[,bash,role="line-numbers,no-copy"]
----
rpk topic create <topic-name> -c redpanda.remote.read=true
----
....


For more details about code blocks, refer to link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#source-code[AsciiDoctor] documentation.

=== Bold text

Use bold text to indicate that a string is UI text. Do not use a bold font to emphasize a word or phrase.

* *Correct:* Enter a name for the new cluster in the *Cluster name* field.
* *Incorrect:* You must have Redpanda version *21.11.3* or later installed to use Shadow Indexing.

=== Quotation marks

Do not use quotation marks. Check the sections in this guide for italics and bold, and if those situations do not apply, reword your sentence to alleviate the need for the quotation marks.

== Future features or releases

Avoid mentioning any future features or releases within the documentation. Such referrals could be construed as a promise to deliver, which is not within the scope of product documentation.

== Placeholders

Placeholders in sample code and commands represent values that the user must replace. Placeholders in example output can also represent other values that vary. A placeholder has a descriptive name as its value. Separate words with a dash. *Do not* use possessives or instructions as values, such as replace-with or my-value.

If your sample code and command placeholders occur in a sentence, use the following formatting:

`<placeholder-value>`

When you use a placeholder in text or code, explain the placeholder the first time you use it. It's not necessary to repeat the explanation in the document unless doing so might benefit the user. For example:

.Create the topic
----
rpk topic create <topic-name>
----

The Redpanda documentation UI includes a custom script that makes placeholder values in code blocks editable.

NOTE: Editable placeholders are disabled in XML code blocks

== Tabs

Tabs in documentation can enhance the user experience and make information more digestible:

- Tabs can be used to present the same information for different contexts. For example, code snippets could be presented in various programming languages under different tabs, allowing the user to choose their preferred language.

- By separating information into different tabs, the reader is not overwhelmed with too much information at once. They can focus on the information presented in one tab at a time.

- Instead of having long, scrollable pages, tabs allow for a more compact, efficient use of space.

CAUTION: Too many tabs can lead to confusion, and important information can be missed if it is hidden in a less obvious tab. The use of tabs should enhance the user experience, not detract from it.

.Tabs syntax
....
[tabs]
======
Tab A::
+
--
Contents of Tab A.
--

Tab B::
+
--
Contents of Tab B.
--

Tab C::
+
--
Contents of Tab C.

Contains more than one block.
--
======
....

You can nest tabs one level deep like so:

.Nested tabs syntax
[,asciidoc]
----
[tabs]
======
Tab A::
+
--
[tabs]
====
Nested Tab A::
+
Content
+
More content
====
--

Tab B::
+
--
Contents of Tab B.
--

Tab C::
+
--
Contents of Tab C.

Contains more than one block.
--
======
----

NOTE: Each new line in a nested tab must contain a `+`.

Each tab item has a unique ID. When a user clicks on a tab, a query string is appended to the URL that points to the tab's ID so that users can share links to the tab.

The tabs syntax and rendering is provided by the `asciidoctor-tabs` module. For more details about using tabs, see the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-tabs[module's GitHub repository].

== Context switcher

We often have separate topics (pages) for doing the same task in different deployment environments, for example Kubernetes and Linux. We use separate topics so that we can write for the correct persona rather than filling topics with conditional phrases.

However, with this approach, users may come across a topic that doesn't apply to their deployment such as from an internal or external search result. We need to make it easy for users to find the right context from whichever page they land on.

The context switcher consists of buttons at the top of a topic that links to equivalent topics for other deployment environments. This comes with a couple of improvements to the user experience:

- It's easy to see if the topic is covered for other deployment scenarios.
- It's easy for users to switch contexts when they realize that they are in the wrong one.

To create a context switcher, add the `page-context-links` attribute to each page that requires it. The attribute should contain an array of objects that includes:

- `name`: The label to give the button in the UI.
- `to`: The {url-antora-docs}/antora/latest/page/resource-id-coordinates/[resource ID] of the page to link to.

For each object in the array, a button is added to the top of the page.

For example:

[,asciidoc]
----
= Redpanda Quickstart
:page-context-links: [{"name": "Docker", "to": "quick-start.adoc" },{"name": "Cloud", "to": "quick-start-cloud.adoc" }]
----

image::../images/context-switcher.png[]

== Glossary terms

Defining glossary terms in documentation ensures clear and consistent communication by facilitating a common understanding among team members and users.

Glossary terms in Redpanda documentation are rendered with a tooltip that displays the definition on hover. Terms also include links to their full definition in the glossary page if one exists.

image::../images/term.png[,100]

To include glossary terms in Redpanda documentation:

. Make sure that the term is defined in a file in the {url-docs}/tree/shared/modules/terms[`terms` module] of the `shared` branch.
. If the term is not yet defined, submit a pull request to add a file for your term.
. Use the `glossterm` macro:

[,asciidoc]
----
This is an important glossterm:<term-name>:[]
----

Replace `<term-name>` with the term.

At build time, the {url-extensions}[`aggregate-terms` extension] makes the `term-name` and `hover-text` attributes available to the `glossterm` macro. It also looks for a `reference:glossary.adoc` file in each component version and if it exists adds all the term file contents to it.

For local development, you can define terms and their definitions inline:

[,asciidoc]
----
This is an important glossterm:<term-name>:[<definition>]
----

IMPORTANT: Links to the glossary page are provided only when terms are defined in the {url-docs}/tree/shared/modules/terms[`terms` module] of the `shared` branch.

=== Glossary pages

To produce a glossary page with all terms that have been defined in the `shared` component, create an empty page called `glossary.adoc` in the `reference` module and include a title:

[,asciidoc]
----
= Glossary
----

During the build, an extension collects all the terms in the {url-docs}/tree/shared/modules/terms[`terms` module] of the `shared` branch, sorts them alphabetically by the file name, and adds them to the page.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to add the glossary page to the nav tree.

== Link macros

The Redpanda documentation includes custom macros to make it easier for writers to link to common pages.

Using a macro to generate links provides the following benefits:

- You can use the macro instead of manually typing the URL each time, reducing the chance of errors.

- If the URL changes in the future, you would only need to update the macro's definition in one place, instead of searching and replacing every occurrence throughout your documentation.

- Using a macro can improve readability in the source code, especially if the URL is long or complicated, as it can be encapsulated into a meaningful and concise macro name.

=== Link to Helm values

To make it easier to link to the Redpanda Helm chart's `values.yaml` file on ArtifactHub, the Redpanda documentation uses a custom macro called `helm_ref`.

To use the macro:

[,asciidoc]
----
helm_ref:<helmRef>[]
----

Where `<helmRef>` is the Helm configuration value you want to reference in the `values.yaml` file.

For example:

Given a Helm reference value of `myConfigValue`, you would use the macro like this:

[,asciidoc]
----
helm_ref:myConfigValue[]
----

This will generate the following output:

For default values and documentation for configuration options, see the https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/redpanda-data/redpanda?modal=values&path=myConfigValue[values.yaml] file.

If you do not specify a Helm reference value, the macro generates a link without specifying a path.

The source code is in the {url-extensions} GitHub repository.

=== Link to Tiered Storage configuration properties

To make it easier to link to Tiered Storage properties, the Redpanda documentation uses a custom macro called `config_ref`.

The config_ref macro is used in an AsciiDoc document as follows:

[,asciidoc]
----
config_ref:configRef,isLink,path[]
----

For example:

[,asciidoc]
----
config_ref:example_config,true,tunable-properties[]
----

The config_ref macro takes three parameters:

configRef::
This is the configuration reference, which is also used to generate the anchor link if isLink is true.

isLink::
Whether the output should be a link. If isLink is set to true, the output will be a cross-reference (xref) to the relevant configuration value.

path::
This is the path to the document where the configuration value is defined. This parameter is used to to generate the link if isLink is true.

IMPORTANT: The path must be the name of a document at the root of the `reference` module.

NOTE: The `config_ref` macro is environment-aware. It checks if the document it is being used in is part of a Kubernetes environment by checking if the `env-kubernetes` attribute is set in the document's attributes. Depending on this check, it either prepends `storage.tieredConfig.` to the `configRef` or just uses the `configRef` as is.

The source code is in the {url-extensions} GitHub repository.

== Images

When possible, use images to supplement the documentation text. You might want to use any of the following types of images:

* Architecture diagrams
* UI screenshots
* Charts and graphs

In Asciidoc, you can assign links to images and define their size. See https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/images/

== External linking

If the server that you're linking to supports HTTPS, start the URL with https. If the server doesn't support HTTPS, start the URL with http.

For details about external links in Asciidoc, see:

- https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/autolinks/[Autolinks]
- https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/link-macro/[Link Macro]
- https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/complex-urls/[Troubleshooting complex URLs]

=== Notes and warnings

Redpanda product documentation uses AsciiDoc note and warning admonitions:

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Notice | Description

| NOTE
| A supplement to the documentation with helpful information.

| TIP
| Describes a way to make things easier or indicates a best practice.

| CAUTION
| A warning that certain behavior is unexpected or may have unintended consequences.

| IMPORTANT
| An important note.
|===

For details about Asciidoc admonitions, see https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/blocks/admonitions/

== Numbers

For whole numbers between one and nine, spell out the number (for example, nine instead of 9). For numbers greater than 9, or any decimal or negative number, use Arabic numerals (for example, 1.5 or -2).

* *Correct:* To run Redpanda in a three-node cluster, use this command: `rpk container start -n 3`
* *Incorrect:* To run Redpanda in a 3-node cluster, use this command: `rpk container start -n 3`

The exception to this is within code or when you’re referring to a default value. For example:

* *Correct:* cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_d_coeff - The derivative coefficient for the upload controller. Default is 0.
* *Incorrect:* cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_d_coeff - The derivative coefficient for the upload controller. Default is zero.

== Personally identifiable information

* Do not include links to personal blogs or non-Redpanda assets.
* Do not use any examples that contain any customer or Redpanda-internal identifiable information (for example, CLASSPATH info from a customer).

== Property descriptions

If you have just a few properties to describe, you can define them in a bulleted list. Put the property name in code font, followed by a dash and the description. The description does not have to be a complete sentence. After the description, add the default value by writing __Default: <value>__. For example:

* `property_name` - Property description. Default: value

Here’s an example as it would appear in the documentation:

* `cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_p_coeff` - The proportional coefficient for the upload controller. Default: -2

If you have three or more properties, you can put them in a table. The table should have two columns: Property and Description. The Property column only includes the property name. The Description column includes a description of the property, which does not have to be a complete sentence, followed by the default value: __Default: <value>__.

Here’s an example of a table:

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Description

| `cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_update_interval_ms`
| Recompute interval for the upload controller. Default: 60000 ms.

| `cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_p_coeff`
| Proportional coefficient for the upload controller. Default: -2

| `cloud_storage_upload_ctrl_min_shares`
| The minimum number of I/O and CPU shares that the remote write process can use. Default: 100
|===

For adding or editing properties on a page with many properties, such as a reference page of properties, define each property within a heading.

Here's an example of a property as a heading:

....
==== disable_public_metrics

Disable registering metrics exposed on the public metrics endpoint.

**Type**: boolean

**Default**: false

**Restart required**: yes
....

== Tables

Tables can be helpful for visualizing information or as a reference after reading the documentation. The Tiered Storage topic contains tables that are a different way of presenting the same information that’s included in the text. To break lines in table cells, use `+`.

This is an excellent tool that you can use to help you create Asciidoc Tables: https://tableconvert.com/markdown-to-asciidoc

For details about creating Asciidoc tables, see https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/tables/build-a-basic-table/

== Word list

[options="header"]
|===
|Term|Description|Examples

|(s)
|Do not use to indicate an optional plural. Use the plural.
|
|Access control list (ACL)
|Spell it out the first time you introduce it on a page, with the acronym in parentheses. After that, you can just use the acronym. Always capitalize the acronym. Do not capitalize access control list unless it’s the first word in a sentence. The plural is ACLs. First time you introduce it on a page: access control list (ACL), access control lists (ACLs). 
All subsequent references on the page.
